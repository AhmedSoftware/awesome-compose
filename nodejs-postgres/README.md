#NodeJS with Postgres Connection

This is a sample project that demonstrates how to connect a NodeJS app using Express to a Postgres database using Docker Compose. The project includes the following components:

1. NodeJS app using Express
2. Postgres database
3. Docker Compose file to set up the environment 

##Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:

1. _docker-compose.yml_: The Docker Compose file that defines the services for the NodeJS app and Postgres database, and the network connections between them.
2. _nodejs directory_: Contains the NodeJS code, including index.js and Dockerfile for building the NodeJS app image.
3. _postgres directory_: Contains the Dockerfile for building the Postgres database image.

##Getting Started
To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. From the root of the directory, run docker-compose up to start the environment.
3. The NodeJS app will be available at http://localhost:3000 and the Postgres database can be accessed at postgres://myuser:mypassword@localhost:5432/mydb.
Expected Results
When you access the NodeJS app at http://localhost:3000, you should see the message "Hello World!" displayed in the browser.

##Conclusion
This project provides a simple example of how to connect a NodeJS app to a Postgres database using Docker Compose. The project structure follows a standard naming convention and separates the code for the two services into separate directories. By using Docker Compose, it's easy to set up a development environment that can be used to test and debug your NodeJS and Postgres applications.
