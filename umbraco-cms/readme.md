# Umbraco CMS Docker compose file

This sample project will start up the [Umbraco CMS](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS/) in a Docker container, with an attached database container running SQL Server. 

*Note: The current version is released using version 9 of the CMS, but that will be updated to version 10 after the [2022 Codegarden conference](http://codegarden.umbraco.com/), when version 10 will be launced officially.*
